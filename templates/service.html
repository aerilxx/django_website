                                        <p>Suffering from depression goes beyond feeling sad all the time. Depression can impact your ability to sleep, work, and enjoy your life. When kids have depression, it's hard for them to make an effort, even when doing things they used to enjoy. Depression can make kids feel worthless, rejected, or unlovable. It can make everyday problems seem more difficult than they actually are. For young people, getting diagnosed and starting treatment early can be more effective and can help prevent long-term issues—provided they’ve been properly diagnosed and they’re on the right treatment plan! </p>
